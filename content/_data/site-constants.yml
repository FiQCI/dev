      Kvasi, the Atos Quantum Learning Machine or Qaptiva is a quantum computing simulator with which you can learn to use and develop new quantum algorithms. Kvasi provides a platform for developing and simulating quantum algorithms in both ideal and realistic, noisy conditions. Kvasi is capable of simulating algorithms for quantum computers of 30+ qubits.
