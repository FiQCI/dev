      Helmi, the first Finnish quantum computer, co-developed by VTT and IQM Quantum Computers, 
      is operated by VTT in Espoo, Finland. Helmi is based on superconducting technology, 
      and presently provides five qubits. Upgrades to 20, then 50 qubits is planned for the near future.

      Kvasi, the Atos Quantum Learning Machine or Qaptiva is a quantum computing simulator with which you can learn 
      to use and develop new quantum algorithms. Kvasi provides a platform for developing and simulating quantum 
      algorithms in both ideal and realistic, noisy conditions. Kvasi is capable of simulating algorithms for 
      quantum computers of 30+ qubits.

about:
  desc: |-
    The Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure (FiQCI) was established in 2020, when it became
    part of the Finnish Research Infrastructure (FIRI) roadmap of significant national research
    infrastructures within the Finnish research infrastructure ecosystem, maintained by the
    Research Council of Finland.
  
  mission: |-
    The mission of FiQCI is to provide state-of-the-art quantum-computing services such as
    computing time and training to the Finnish RDI communities. This includes providing a
    hybrid high-performance computing and quantum computing (HPC+QC) platform for developing,
    testing, and exploiting quantum-accelerated computational workflows. Through FiQCI, Finnish
    researchers have access to one of the most powerful hybrid HPC+nQC resources in the world,
    available for quantum accelerated research and development. The infrastructure also aims to
    offer possibilities to carry out experiments in quantum physics.

  maintain: |-
    FiQCI is jointly maintained, operated, and developed by VTT, Aalto University, and
    CSC - IT Center for Science.
  
  advisory-group:

      The Scientific and Technical Advisory Group (STAG) provides input for the operation
      of the infrastructure. The current (2023) members of the STAG are:
