        <p>
            The Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure (FiQCI) was established in 2020, when it became
            part of the Finnish Research Infrastructure (FIRI) roadmap of significant national research
            infrastructures within the Finnish research infrastructure ecosystem, maintained by the
            Research Council of Finland.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>
            The mission of FiQCI is to provide state-of-the-art quantum-computing services such as
            computing time and training to the Finnish RDI communities. This includes providing a
            hybrid high-performance computing and quantum computing (HPC+QC) platform for developing,
            testing, and exploiting quantum-accelerated computational workflows. Through FiQCI, Finnish
            researchers have access to one of the most powerful hybrid HPC+nQC resources in the world,
            available for quantum accelerated research and development. The infrastructure also aims to
            offer possibilities to carry out experiments in quantum physics.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <p>
            FiQCI is jointly maintained, operated, and developed by VTT, Aalto University, and
            CSC - IT Center for Science.

        <p>
            The Scientific and Technical Advisory Group (STAG) provides input for the operation
            of the infrastructure. The current (2023) members of the STAG are:
