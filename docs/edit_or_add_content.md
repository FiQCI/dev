# Editing and adding content

Most of the static (constant) content of the site is fetched from `content/_data/constants.yml`.
Therefore to edit the content of the website one edits the constants.yml file.
This file describes the basic structure of the contanst.yml file and explains how to make changes to the content on the site.


## New announcement

In constants edit:
```yml
"/":
  hero:
      announcement: #the orange announcement box
        text: Access to VTT Q50 for accepted projects now open! #Announcement text
        link:
          title: How to access Q50, instructions #Link display text
          href: "#" #Link address
```

## New Quantum Computer

Add the quantum computer to the lists at:
```yml
"/status/":
  quantum-computers:
    - name: VTT Q5 (Helmi)
      qubits: 5
      basis: "PRX, CZ"
      topology: "Star"
      device_id: "Q5"
    ...
```

and

```yml
"/access/":
  quantum_resources: #list of the available quantum resources
    - name: VTT Q5 (Helmi)
      desc: |-
       The VTT Q5 "Helmi" is the first Finnish quantum computer. Helmi is based on superconducting technology and provides 5 qubits
       in a star-shape topology. Hybrid HPC+QC access was opened in 2022. Helmi is operated by VTT,
       and was co-developed with IQM Quantm Computers.
      image: "/assets/images/vtt-images/VTT_lab-2.jpg"
      links:
        - link: ""
          teaser: "How to access VTT Q5, instructions"
          icon: mdiArrowRight
        - link: ""
          teaser: "Read more about VTT Q5 (VTT website)"
          icon: mdiOpenInNew
    ...
```

The latter applies also for new supercomputer and emulation resources.

## New page

A new page can be added by creating a `your-page-name.md` file in `content/pages/` and a corresponding `your-page-namemd.jsx` in `src/pages/`. If the page is only static content (no react components) the file should look something like:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom'

import { PageLayout } from '../layouts/page.html'

import { useJsonApi } from '../hooks/useJsonApi'


const MyPageView = () => {
    const themeConstants = useJsonApi('api/theme/constants.json')

    return <>
        <PageLayout {...themeConstants} title="MyPage" />
    </>
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('react-root'))

    root.render(<MyPageView />)
})

```

All the content of the page should then be in `you-page-name.md` that looks something like:

```js
---
layout: page
title: My Page Title
subtitle: My Page Subtitle
react: true
---

{% assign about_data = site.data.constants.["/my-page/"] %}

<div>
    all your content here
</div>
```

If the pages needs react components inserted into it the file should be something like (assuming react component defined in src/components/MyComponent.jsx):

```js
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom'

import { MyComponent } from '../components/MyComponent'

import { PageLayout } from '../layouts/page.html'

import { useJsonApi } from '../hooks/useJsonApi'


const MyPage = () => {
    const themeConstants = useJsonApi('api/theme/constants.json')
    const myPageProps = themeConstants["/myPage/"]
    return <>
        <PageLayout {...themeConstants} title="MyPage" />
        {createPortal(
            <MyComponent {...myPageProps}/>,
            document.getElementById('my-component')
        )}
    </>
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('react-root'))

    root.render(<MyPage />)
})
```

And `you-page-name.md` should the look something like:

```js
---
title: My Page Title
layout: page
subtitle: My Page Subtitle
react: true
---

<div>

a bunch of content here

{%- include react/root.html id='my-component' -%}

more content here

<div>
```

or if all of the content is in a react component:

```js
---
title: My Page Title
layout: page
subtitle: My Page Subtitle
react: true
---

{%- include react/root.html id='my-component' -%}
```

To make the page show up in the navigation bar add it to:
```yml
header_nav:
  - title: Home
    page: pages/home.md
  ...
```

in constanst.yml. Additionally add any needed constanst to constants.yml under a new section titled `"/your-page-url/"`

## New / edited text content

To add new text sections simply go to the relevant section in `constants.yml` and add a new field. Then refer to this field in the relevant react component in `src/components` or the relevant markdown file in `content/pages` depending on what page is being edited.


# Structure

The file begins with some global contants used e.g. for the footer, cookie banner, and the navigation bar.
If new pages are added to the site they need to be added here to the header_nav section for the to show up in the navigation bar.

```yml
title: FiQCI
author: The FiQCI Consortium
copyright: © 2024 The FiQCI Consortium
...

header_nav:
  - title: Home
    page: pages/home.md
  - title: About FiQCI
    page: pages/about.md
  ...

cookie_consent:
  title: We Use Cookies
  chapters:
  ...
```

After the global constant the contents are split so that each page has its own section denoted by page url:

```yml
"/":
  ...

"/access/":
  ...

"/about/":
  ...

"/status/":
  ...

...
```

Each section contains static text content, link urls, image paths, etc else that the page is using.

## Home

## About

```yml
"/about/": #static text for the about page
  desc: |-
    The Finnish Quantum-Computing Infrastructure (FiQCI) was established in 2020, when it became
    part of the Finnish Research Infrastructure (FIRI) roadmap of significant national research
    infrastructures within the Finnish research infrastructure ecosystem, maintained by the
    Research Council of Finland.
  
  mission: |-
    The mission of FiQCI is to provide state-of-the-art quantum-computing services such as
    computing time and training to the Finnish RDI communities. This includes providing a
    hybrid high-performance computing and quantum computing (HPC+QC) platform for developing,
    testing, and exploiting quantum-accelerated computational workflows. Through FiQCI, Finnish
    researchers have access to one of the most powerful hybrid HPC+nQC resources in the world,
    available for quantum accelerated research and development. The infrastructure also aims to
    offer possibilities to carry out experiments in quantum physics.

  maintain: |-
    FiQCI is jointly maintained, operated, and developed by VTT, Aalto University, and
    CSC - IT Center for Science.
